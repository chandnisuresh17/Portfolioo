            <strong>ABOUT</strong>
        </h2>
        I'm an Electronics Engineering student, graduated from School of Engineering, CUSAT. As a school student I used to love Semiconductor Physics and Mathematics which is why I opted for the branch of Electronics and Communication. Now I have also developed an interest in the software field.

I spend my free time doing courses and projects based on software development and trying out new platforms like IBM Cloud Bluemix , Web Development etc. I hope to join the IT field by the end of my Bachelor Degree.

My college has provided me with good opportunities to improve my skills. I Hope, I can be a good software developer in the future.
